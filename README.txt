My android game is RPS (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Basically pick an option and it is played against a random cpu choice. Dialogue opens with the result of the game.
My code is available at github under the public repository of ShaurinD in EECS481. Code is in the RPS directory. Build by importing into ADK.
